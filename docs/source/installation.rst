Installation
============
You can install alea from PyPI using pip but **beware that it is listed there as alea-inference!** Thus, you need to run

.. code-block:: console

    $ pip install alea-inference


For the latest version, you can install directly from the GitHub repository by cloning the repository and running

.. code-block:: console

    $ cd alea
    $ pip install .

You are now ready to use alea!
